<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium Foams Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex-situ Bonded Aluminium Foams</li><li>In-situ Bonded Aluminium Foams</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminium foams market is primarily categorized into two types: ex-situ bonded and in-situ bonded aluminium foams. Ex-situ bonded aluminium foams involve incorporating gas-forming agents into molten metal before solidification, creating a lightweight structure through a foaming process. In-situ bonded aluminium foams, on the other hand, are produced by introducing gas-generating materials directly during the metallurgical processing, resulting in a more integrated foam with improved mechanical properties. Both types are utilized across industries for their thermal insulation and energy absorption capabilities.</p></p>
