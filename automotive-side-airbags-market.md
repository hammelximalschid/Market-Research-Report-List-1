<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Side Airbags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Torso Airbags</li><li>Side Tubular or Curtain Airbags</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive side airbags market includes two main types: side torso airbags and side tubular (curtain) airbags. Side torso airbags are designed to protect the upper body and ribs in side-impact collisions, deploying from the seat or door. In contrast, side tubular airbags, or curtain airbags, deploy downwards from the vehicle's roof to shield occupants’ heads during side impacts and rollovers. Both types enhance passenger safety by absorbing impact forces and minimizing injury risks in side collisions.</p></p>
