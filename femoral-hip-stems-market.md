<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Hip Stems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Femoral Hip Stems</li><li>Cementless Femoral Hip Stems</li><li>Hybrid Femoral Hip Stems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The femoral hip stems market includes three main types: cemented, cementless, and hybrid femoral hip stems. Cemented femoral stems utilize bone cement for secure fixation, commonly used in older patients or those with poor bone quality. Cementless stems rely on a porous surface that encourages bone growth for fixation, often preferred in younger, active patients. Hybrid stems combine both methods, featuring a cemented stem with a cementless component, catering to various patient needs and improving overall implant stability and longevity.</p></p>
