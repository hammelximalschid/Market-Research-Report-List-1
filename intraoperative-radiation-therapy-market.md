<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electron IORT</li><li>Intraoperative Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) includes two primary market types: Electron IORT and Intraoperative Brachytherapy. Electron IORT utilizes high-energy electrons delivered directly to the tumor site during surgery, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue while maximizing dose to the target. Intraoperative Brachytherapy, on the other hand, involves placing radioactive sources within or near the tumor during the surgical procedure, allowing for precise localized treatment. Both methods enhance intraoperative precision and enable improved patient outcomes in cancer therapy.</p></p>
