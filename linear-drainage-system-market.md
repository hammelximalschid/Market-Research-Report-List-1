<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface</li><li>Underground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear drainage system market is divided into two primary types: surface drainage and underground drainage. Surface drainage systems collect and channel excess water on the ground's surface, utilizing channels, grates, or trenches to direct runoff away from sensitive areas. In contrast, underground drainage systems manage water below the surface, employing pipes and culverts to transport excess water safely. Both systems are essential for effective stormwater management, preventing flooding, and protecting infrastructure in urban and rural settings.</p></p>
