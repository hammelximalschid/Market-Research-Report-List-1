<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Packet Broker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline Network Packet Broker</li><li>Non-inline Network Packet Broker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Network Packet Broker (NPB) market is categorized primarily into inline and non-inline types. Inline Network Packet Brokers are positioned directly in the data path, allowing them to inspect, filter, and manipulate traffic in real-time, enhancing security and performance. In contrast, Non-inline Network Packet Brokers operate off the data path, capturing and analyzing packets without direct intervention in traffic flow, making them ideal for monitoring and analysis without impacting network performance. Both types serve distinct purposes in network management.</p></p>
