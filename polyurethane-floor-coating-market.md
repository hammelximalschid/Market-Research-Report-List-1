<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Floor Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li><li>Non-Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyurethane floor coating market comprises two main types: solvent-based and non-solvent-based coatings. Solvent polyurethane floor coatings utilize organic solvents to dissolve the polyurethane resin, providing a durable and robust finish ideal for high-traffic areas. However, they emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, non-solvent polyurethane floor coatings, which are typically water-based, offer a more environmentally friendly option with lower VOC emissions, making them suitable for residential and commercial applications where indoor air quality is a concern.</p></p>
