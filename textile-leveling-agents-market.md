<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Textile Leveling Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fibrophilic Leveling Agents</li><li>Dye-Philic Leveling Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Textile leveling agents are crucial for achieving uniform dye application in fabrics. Fibrophilic leveling agents have a strong affinity for the fiber, promoting even dye distribution and reducing streaks. They ensure that dye adheres uniformly to the fabric surface. In contrast, dye-philic leveling agents have a high affinity for the dye molecules, facilitating better dispersion and minimizing dye aggregation, which helps in achieving consistent color intensity. Both types enhance the overall quality and appearance of dyed textiles.</p></p>
